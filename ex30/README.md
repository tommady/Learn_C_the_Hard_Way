LICENSE
    If you release the source of your projects you'll want to include a license. If you don't though, the code is copyright by you and nobody has rights to it by default.
README.md
    Basic instructions for using your project go here. It ends in .md so that it will be interpreted as markdown.
Makefile
    The main build file for the project.
bin/
    Where programs that users can run go. This is usually empty and the Makefile will create it if it's not there.
build/
    Where libraries and other build artifacts go. Also empty and the Makefile will create it if it's not there.
src/
    Where the source code goes, usually .c and .h files.
tests/
    Where automated tests go.
src/dbg.h
    I copied the dbg.h from Exercise 20 into src/ for later.
